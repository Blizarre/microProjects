A few days ago I took a picture of the night sky using my camera, right in the middle of nowhere. I expected a nice clear picture but no matter where I looked, there was always some background light, and the sensor noise was quite strong.

The script ***improveSkyImage.py*** is a simple way to improve the quality of the image, by removing the ambient light and the noise. more information on my blog at http://www.marache.net/image-improvement-using-opencv/

As a bonus, I also designed a small script to estimate the local orientation of star trails with ***localOrientation.py***.
